        <p>
            I am a Data Analytics undergraduate at Purdue University pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
            in Data Analytics, Technologies, and Applications. My work focuses on using structured 
            data to support operational and manufacturing decision-making.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through applied research with Purdue’s Data Mine and professional experience, I have 
            analyzed performance datasets, validated data accuracy, established statistical baselines, 
            and developed interactive Power BI dashboards to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am particularly interested in manufacturing and operations analytics, where data quality, 
            process monitoring, and clear reporting drive measurable improvements. I am seeking 
            internship opportunities where I can apply my analytical skills in real-world environments 
            while continuing to grow in collaboration and continuous improvement.
